# HACKING WITH PYTHON
### By NITISH KHANNA

##### Hello everyone,

In Scanning I have created two tools :

1) port-scan.py
2) advance-port-scan.py


## Working with port-scan.py
This tool uses "socket" and "sys" library of python 

To run this just use following command

``` bash
python3 port-scan.py
```
- After running this it will ask you for target domain or target ip any of your choice.
- Enter Port you want tool should start from
- Enter last Port till you want tool to scan
- It will automatically runs and tells you the open ports with the service name running on it


## Working with advance-port-scan.py
This tool uses "socket" library and "nmap" module of python to scan open ports and their Vulnerabilities

To run this just use following command

``` bash
pip install python-nmap
```

``` bash
python3 advance-port-scan.py
```
- After running this it will ask you for target domain or target ip any of your choice.
- Enter Port you want tool should start from
- Enter last Port till you want tool to scan
- It will automatically runs and tells you the open ports with service running on them after that Vulnerabilities of open ports

# HACKING WITH PYTHON
### By NITISH KHANNA

##### Hello everyone,

In backdoor creation I have created 2 files:
1) run-in-your-machine.py  
This file you need to run on your server or machine to start listening so that target machine can able to connect with your machine
``` bash
python3 run-in-your-machine.py
```

2) run-on-target.py
This file you need to run on target machine to start backdoor so that you can able to enter shell with your machine

``` bash
python3 run-on-target.py
```
- Once connection successful you will be able to run all shell commands

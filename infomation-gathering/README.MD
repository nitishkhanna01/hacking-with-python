# HACKING WITH PYTHON
### By NITISH KHANNA

##### Hello everyone,

In Information gathering I have created a tool which uses whois module of python to gather the information.

This tools ask you ip or domain of target server.

To use this tool run the following commands 
``` bash
pip install python-whois
```
``` bash
python3 whoislookup.py
```
- Just need to enter domain name and options to store output or not it will work automatically
